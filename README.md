# What is this?

This is a learning project I'm willing to grow up adding new feature every day each with some well-know library, a framework or a concept. My aim is to drive a train.

## Day one

Created a web application with [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) using it's routers and templates. JSON unmarshalling and HTTP requests also has been covered.

## Day two

Created a Domain/IP database with [gorm](https://gorm.io). Domains are resolved on-the-fly and are stored into the database. Gin's HTTP args and POST params are covered too.
